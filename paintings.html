    <p class="detail-summary">
      Painting is where intuition meets deliberate structure. These works explore luminous color palettes, unexpected
      architecture, and atmospheric storytelling—capturing the feeling of stepping into a world moments before the scene
      shifts.

      <h2>Studio notes</h2>
      <p>
        Paintings begin with plein-air thumbnails translated into digital studies. Each final piece blends those sketches
        with invented architecture to build believable yet dreamlike environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Texture passes are intentionally loose, inviting collaboration from writers and sound designers who will extend
        these moments into larger narrative arcs.
